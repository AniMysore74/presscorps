##Press Corps

#####The Wordpress theme built for `Model UN`'s!

Press Corps is wordpress theme built for easily creating wordpress-blogs for the Press Sites at Model UN conferences. 

IMPORTANT: **TO CONFIGURE THIS THEME PROPERLY YOU MUST BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALLATION FOLDER ON YOUR SERVER VIA FTP.** This will change soon.

###Features:

1) Committee-specific posts  : Committees are added as categories. To get the committee picture to show as a thumbnail on the site, just place the committe image in `your-wordpress-installation-folder-name/wp-content/themes/presscorps/images`. Images must be named `committee-name.jpg`. 

2) Logo and Background : Similar to Committee images. Change the logo and background at `your-wordpress-installation-folder-name/wp-content/themes/presscorps/images`.

###Future Updates:

- FTP access not needed to use theme. Configuration can done using theme customization present in wordpress.
